<h1>Tree data structure</h1>

Trees are widely used and effective when storing large numbers of elements. 
One might consider a tree to be something like a number of linked list all connected together.
Recursion is well suited to traversal of trees. 

These exercises cover the basic principles of a tree data structure. Each element contains an integer and
the elements (or 'nodes') are sorted accordingly. 
The trees are made up of a 'root node' which is the parent node for all the remaining nodes in that tree. 
Each node (including the root) has two child nodes. A node that has no child nodes e known as le
