JavaExercises
=============

These are a series of coding tasks that formed majority part of the 'Programming in Java' module 
run by Dr Keith L Mannock, Sokratis Karkalas and Dr Sergio G Santos at Birkbeck College London.
(The questions were put together by Dr Santos, 2012).

They constitute more than 200 hours of coding/learning time.

They are sufficient to help train a complete beginner (undergraduate student) into a 
Java programmer of a very good standard.


The 'Programming in Java' module represented an important part of the Computer Science
conversion masters at Birkbeck College (2012-2014), along with Object-Oriented Design & Programming, 
Fundamentals of Computing, Data & Knowledge Management, Information Systems, 
Internet & Web Technologies and Computer Systems.
