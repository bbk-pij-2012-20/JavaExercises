<h1>JavaExercises</h1>

These are a series of coding exercises that formed the majority part (Oct-Dec 2014) of the 'Programming in Java' module run by Dr Keith L Mannock, Sokratis Karkalas and Dr Sergio G Santos at Birkbeck College London. (The questions were put together by Dr Santos, 2012). They constitute more than 200 hours of coding & learning time. These Java exercises were followed up by two programming courseworks: https://github.com/bbk-pij-2012-20/ContactManager & https://github.com/bbk-pij-2012-20/Quiz

<h1>Tree data structure</h1>

Trees are widely used and effective when storing large numbers of elements.
One might consider a tree to be something like a number of linked list all connected together.
Recursion is well suited to traversal of trees.

These exercises cover the basic principles of a tree data structure. Each element contains an integer and
the elements (or 'nodes') are sorted accordingly.
The trees are made up of a 'root node' which is the parent node for all the remaining nodes in that tree.
Each node (including the root) has two child nodes. A node that has no child nodes e known as le

The topics are organised in the following 12 main subtopics:

<li>Basic scripts #1</li>
<li>Basic scripts #2</li>
<li>Starting to encapsulate (in methods rather than as single scripts in main method)</li>
<li>Recursion (and memoization)</li>
<li>Data structures (including arrays, linked lists & trees)</li>
<li>Maps</li>
<li>Inheritance (including ad hoc polymorphism)</li>
<li>Generics (aka parametric polymorphism)</li>
<li>JUnit & TDD</li>
<li>Error handling</li>
<li>Input output</li>
<li>Concurrency</li>
<li>Network (with RMI)</li></ol>
(A mixture of a few, simple but important Java basics are stored in one subdirectory).<br/>
