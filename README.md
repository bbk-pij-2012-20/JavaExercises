<h1>JavaExercises</h1>These are a series of coding exercises that formed the majority part (Oct-Dec 2014) of the 'Programming in Java' module run by Dr Keith L Mannock, Sokratis Karkalas and Dr Sergio G Santos at Birkbeck College London. (The questions were put together by Dr Santos, 2012). They constitute more than 200 hours of coding & learning time. These Java exercises were followed up by two programming courseworks: https://github.com/bbk-pij-2012-20/ContactManager & https://github.com/bbk-pij-2012-20/Quiz
=======




<br/>The topics are organised in the following main subtopics:
<ol>
<li>Basic scripts #1</li>
<li>Basic scripts #2</li>
<li>Starting to encapsulate (in methods rather than as single scripts in main method)</li>
<li>Recursion (and memoization)</li>
<li>Data structures (including arrays, linked lists & trees)</li>
<li>Maps</li>
<li>Inheritance (including ad hoc polymorphism)</li>
<li>Generics (aka parametric polymorphism)</li>
<li>JUnit & TDD</li>
<li>Error handling</li>
<li>Input output</li>
<li>Concurrency</li>
<li>Network (with RMI)</li></ol>
(A mixture of a few, simple but important Java basics are stored in one subdirectory).<br/>
