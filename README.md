JavaExercises
=============

These are series of coding tasks I undertook as part of the 'Programming in Java' module 
run by Dr Santos and Dr Keith L Mannock and Sokratis Karkalas at Birkbeck College London.
The questions were put together by Dr Santos.

They constitute more than 200 hours of coding/learning time.

They are sufficient to help train a complete beginner (undergraduate student) into a 
Java programmer of a very good standard.


The 'Programming in Java' module represented an important part of the Computer Science
conversion masters at Birkbeck, along with Object-Oriented Design & Programming, 
Fundamentals of Computing, Data & Knowledge Management, Information Systems, 
Internet & Web Technologies and Computer Systems.
