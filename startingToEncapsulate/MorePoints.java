// Exercise 4.6 (Learning the basics. Starting to encapsulate into methods).
/*
Write a program in which you create and use a class called Point, with two fields of 
type double (e.g. x, y) and the following methods:

distanceTo(Point): calculates the distance to another point.
distanceToOrigin(): calculates the distance to the origin. Implement it by calling the 
first method.
moveTo(double x, double y): changes the coordinates of this point to be the given 
parameters x and y.
moveTo(Point): changes the coordinates of this point to move where the given point is.
clone(): returns a copy of the current point with the same coordinates.
opposite(): returns a copy of the current point with the coordinates multiplied by âˆ’1.

Two methods in a class can have the same name (identifier) as long as their parameters 
are different. This is called method overloading and we will see more of that in the future.
