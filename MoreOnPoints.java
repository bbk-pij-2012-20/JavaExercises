/*Day 4 Ex6 - More on points
Write a program in which you create and use a class called Point, 
with two fields of type double (e.g. x, y) and the following methods:
distanceTo(Point): calculates the distance to another point.
distanceToOrigin(): calculates the distance to the origin. 
Implement it by calling the first method. 
moveTo(double x, double y): changes the coordinates of this point to 
be the given parameters x and y. 
moveTo(Point): changes the coordinates of this point to move where 
the given point is.
4
clone(): returns a copy of the current point with the same coordinates.
opposite(): returns a copy of the current point with the coordinates 
multiplied by âˆ’1.
Two methods in a class can have the same name (identifier) as long as 
their parameters are different. This is called METHOD OVERLOADING.*/
