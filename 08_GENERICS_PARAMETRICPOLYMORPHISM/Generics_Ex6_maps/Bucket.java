/*
6.2 Hash table (*)
Create a generic map (with methods for putting a keyâ€“value pair, getting the value for a key,
and removing a key).
The key and the value may be any type, and they may be different.
Under each key, the hash table can store any number of values associated to that key.
For simplicity, assume that your map can hold a maximum of 1000 pairs.
This way, you can use the hashing method you developed in past weeks and base your map on an array.

 * Bucket's array is an array of linked lists.

 * It deals with collisions with a linked list in the 2nd array in this class.
