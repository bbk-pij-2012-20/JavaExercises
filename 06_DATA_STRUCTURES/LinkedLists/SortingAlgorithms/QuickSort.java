// Exercise 7.13 (Using data structures & pointers to implement Sorting Algorithms). Difficulty level: very.
/*
This is a popular sorting algorithm that is very fast in most situations. Once you have finished all the other exercises,
look up in wikipedia how this method works and make your own implementation (put it in ListUtilities.quickSort(List)).
Then compare its performance with the other two methods. In order to see significant differences, you will need to
use lists of some length.
