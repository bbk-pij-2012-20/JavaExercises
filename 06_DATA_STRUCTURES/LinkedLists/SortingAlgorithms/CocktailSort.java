/*
Cocktail sort is a combination of two bubble sorts. First the list is traversed in one direction to move the highest
element to the end, and then it is traversed in the opposite direction to move the lowest element to the beginning.
This bidirectional process is repeated until there are no swaps in the list, which shows that the list is sorted.
Implement cocktail sort in a static method in a class, maybe ListUtilities.cocktailSort(List). The name
of the algorithm comes from a metaphorical cocktail shaker moving up and down, up and down. . .
Try your method with the same lists as bubble sort and see how long it takes to sort them.
