// Exercise 8.4.2 (Introduction to Interfaces and different implementations with data structures)
/*
Use the interface PersonQueue that represents a queue of people waiting at the supermarket and then implement
it. You can use the definition and the implementations of StringStack as a guide. You can reuse any version of
class Person from past days. For example, depending on your implementation, you may want to use a version of
Person with or without internal pointers. 
...
8.4.2 Implement the interface queue in a way that the next person retrieved is always 
a person over 65, if there are any in the queue; if not, it must be a person over 18, 
if there are any in the queue. Inside each age category, the behaviour of the queue is 
typical FIFO: first in, first out.

These two queues are examples of priority queues, and are not strictly FIFO: 
old people will always come out of the queue before younger people, even if the youngsters 
came to the queue first. Priority queues are more difficult to implement, but they are also 
important in computing. For example, your hard disk uses a priority queue to decide where 
to move next: if the diskâ€™s head is at position 555 and the queue of requests is 
4, 99, 234, 500, 101, 43, 881, 77, your disk may decide to move to position 500 to reduce 
movement, time, and energy consumption.
