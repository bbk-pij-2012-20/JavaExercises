/*
Look at the attached program ComputationLauncher for an example of a heavy computation being performed in
sequence or in parallel using more than one processor at the same time. In an old machine with two processors, the
output looks like:
Result: 7.999582837247596E14
Time without threads: 11110ms
Result: 7.999582837247596E14
Time with threads: 6326ms
Make sure you understand how the program works. How would you modify the program if you machine had
four processors? You can see how many processors (or cores) your machine has by reading the value of:
Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors();
