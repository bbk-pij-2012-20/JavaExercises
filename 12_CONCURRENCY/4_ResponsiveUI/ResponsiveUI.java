/*
Write a program that asks from the user the length in milliseconds of ten tasks. As the user enters the length, the
tasks start running in the background while the user enters the length of the other tasks. When the tasks end, the
program must register it and say it unless it is waiting for the user to enter data. See this sample output:
Enter the duration (in ms) of task 0: 10
Enter the duration (in ms) of task 1: 3000
Finished tasks: 0
Enter the duration (in ms) of task 2: 2000
Enter the duration (in ms) of task 3: 1000
Enter the duration (in ms) of task 4: 10
Enter the duration (in ms) of task 5: 1000
Finished tasks: 2, 1, 3, 4
Enter the duration (in ms) of task 6:
...
Note that several tasks may end in between two user inputs.
