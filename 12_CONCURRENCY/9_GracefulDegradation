// Exercise 18.1: Introduction to concurrency

/*
Think of three examples of concurrent applications that you use every week and that
benefit from graceful degradation, i.e. becoming gradually more slow under high
load rather than crashing unexpectedly. Once you have thought of three examples,
check them with one of your colleagues. Have you thought of the same examples?
