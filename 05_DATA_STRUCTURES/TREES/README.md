<h1>Trees</h1>

Trees are widely used and a highly effective data structure, particularly for storing large numbers of elements.

One might consider a tree to be something like a number of branching linked lists that may have a single source element ("root"). Trees that don't have a single root node are called forrests, but these are not dealt with here.

Unlike linked lists, trees are intrinsically sorted (otherwise they would be called
an undirected graph). They also have a search time of log(n).

Recursion is highly suited to traversal of trees.

These exercises cover the basic principles of a tree data structure.
Each element contains an integer and the elements (or 'nodes') are sorted accordingly.

The trees are made up of a 'root node' which is the parent node for all the remaining nodes in that tree.

Each node (including the root) has two child nodes. (A node that has no child nodes is known as a 'leaf'.)

As the nodes have two child nodes, they form what is called a 'Binary Tree'.

The nodes in my Binary Tree are ordered (at the time of adding them) according the value of their integer. Thus this Binary Tree is also called a 'Binary Search Tree'.
