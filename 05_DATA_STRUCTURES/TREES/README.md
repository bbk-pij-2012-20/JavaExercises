<h1>Ad hoc polymorphism (aka inheritance)</h1>

Ad hoc polymorphism is practised here, the use of the Java Interface, Abstract Classes and
(Concrete) Classes.

Exercise 10.8:
The Noah's Ark exercise allowed me to understand the interplay between minimising code repetition and the creating interfaces and classes to aid the semantics and abstraction of
the model.
For example, I could have made the 5 animal classes (Amphibia, Arthropoda etc) concrete instead of abstract classes. I could have left out the abstract makeSound() method but
chose to include it, thereby making the clsses abstract, purely to emphasise that there is likely to be similarities in the sort of noises made by each of the 5 animal classes.
It also allowed me to experience creating a mixture of interface, abstract and concrete classes.

It also served as an exercise in how to annotate the package and import for each of the classes which were subdivided into subfolders. In fact, this was problematic from the
text editor, but easily done in Eclipse.
