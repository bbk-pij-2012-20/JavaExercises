/* Day 4, Ex3 - A bit more practice with doubles
Write a program that asks the user for the total amount borrowed for a mortgage, 
the number of years to pay it back, and the interest rate (in this exercise, we 
assume it is a fixed rate). The program can then calculate how much must be paid 
at the end t=c.(1+(r/100)) 
where t is the total, c is the cost, and r is the rate as a percentage. 
The program should print: the total amount to be paid, the money to be paid every 
year and the number of years before the interest is paid and only the initial 
capital remains. Write a method to calculate each piece of data.
