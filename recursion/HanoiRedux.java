/*
The legend of the Towers of Hanoi has inspired countless variations as mind games. 
Here is one of them: if we have three posts and 64 discs, where all the even-numbered 
discs are on the leftmost post while the odd-numbered discs are on the rightmost post, 
how many moves do we need to exchange the discs following the Hanoi rules for disc
movement?
Write a method that calculates the number of moves necessary to exchange n discs.
