/*
Create a method that calculates the solution to the problem of the eight Dames: “given a chess board, and knowing
that the Dame can reach any tile horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, place 8 Dames on the board so that none
of them can reach the others by doing only one move”. You can return the solution as an array of 8x8 booleans
where eight tiles are true (those with the Dames on them) and the others are false.
For extra complexity, make your method return all the possibilities in which the problem can be solved (this
may take a long time).
