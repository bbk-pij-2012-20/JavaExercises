// Exercise 5.4 (Recursion, recursion vs iteration). Difficulty level: medium

/*
Create a program with a (recursive) method that takes a String paremeter and returns 
true if the String is a palindrome and false otherwise. Compare this recursive version 
with the iterative version you wrote in past weeks.
Which one seems clearer to you?
